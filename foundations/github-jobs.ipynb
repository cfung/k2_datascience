So software is a critical piece of WAZER\\u2019s offering. The WAZER multiplatform application will allow a user to define exact cutting paths on their source materials. To do this the software will need to be able to upload and convert drawing files into a rendered interactive format that is presented to the user. The user will be able to adjust and tune their cutting paths based on their uploaded 2D drawings and will be guided through the basic setup of the machine. Lastly, the software will need to be able to convert all the adjusted paths into a WAZER machine readable format (already defined) which will produce the consumer\\u2019s desired cut.

WAZER isn\\u2019t just the world\\u2019s first desktop waterjet cutter but the world\\u2019s first solution that allows any computer-literate user to go from their idea to cutting any material within minutes. So software is a critical piece of WAZER\\u2019s offering. The WAZER multiplatform application will allow a user to define exact cutting paths on their source materials. To do this the software will need to be able to upload and convert drawing files into a rendered interactive format that is presented to the user. The user will be able to adjust and tune their cutting paths based on their uploaded 2D drawings and will be guided through the basic setup of the machine. Lastly, the software will need to be able to convert all the adjusted paths into a WAZER machine readable format (already defined) which will produce the consumer\\u2019s desired cut.
